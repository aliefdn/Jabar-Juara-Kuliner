An exploratory dataset about how West Java can optimize their culinary field for better economic growth.
Both from the tourism sector (restaurants) and MSMEs, it is clear that the potential of the culinary sector is very high to become a driving force for the West Java economy. In fact, if studied further, the culinary sector will have an impact related to the food supply sector such as livestock and plantations, as well as being a source of other types of regional income. The West Java government needs to see this as a more promising opportunity in fostering all areas of West Java related to the culinary sector.
